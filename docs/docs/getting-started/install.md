# Install

Net-Doc is distributed as a docker container.

## Docker Compose

> The tag `latest` will always pull the latest
> [release](https://github.com/Longridge-High-School/net-doc/releases), `main`
> will pull the latest commit to the main branch. Ideally you should use the
> major version tag e.g. `2` to avoid automatically installing any breaking
> changes. `2` would include any `2.x.y` release.

### Environment Variables

| Variable        | Value                                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PASSWORD_KEY`  | Your unique Password Key. Used to encrypt the passwords stored in the database.                             |
| `PASSWORD_SLAT` | Your unique Password Salt. Used to salt the value for encryption of passwords in the database.              |
| `PASSWORD_IV`   | The initiation vector for your password encryption. Needs to be a 16 Character HEX Value.                   |
| `DATABASE_URL`  | The file path to your database. Should be `file:./data/something.db` so that the data is stored on the host |

### Volumes

| Container Path        | Purpose                                                   |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/app/prisma/data`    | Contains the sqlite database                              |
| `/app/public/uploads` | [Attachments](/docs/fields/attachment) are uploaded here. |
| `/app/public/backups` | Contains the generated backup files                       |

## Launching

With the `docker-compose.yml` in a folder with the paths updated you can then
pull the images.

```sh
docker compose pull
```

Once the images are pulled you can launch net-doc by running:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

This will create a new docker container running the Net-Doc image, and the redis
image.

Every time Net-Doc starts up it runs all the
[prisma migrations](https://github.com/Longridge-High-School/net-doc/tree/main/prisma/migrations)
to intially create the database and keep it in sync. The same process also runs
the seed command which will update any data in the database to match the new
schema.
