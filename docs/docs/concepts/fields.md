# Fields

Fields are the building blocks of [assets](/net-doc/docs/concepts/assets).

Fields are their own object that can be attached to multiple assets. For example
an `Asset Tag` field could be attached to any asset that corresponds to a
physical asset in your environment. This single fields values would all be
linked across every asset.

## Creating a Field

From the Field Manager click _Add Field_. You will be asked for a `Name` which
is used to identify the field, and as the heading when the field is displayed.
The `Description` is the internal description of the field that appears in the
Asset Manager when editing an Asset.
