Net-Doc has a document store that can be used to store any markdown document.

When linking to an [entry](/net-doc/docs/concepts/entries) the document will
appear as a _Linked Document_ in the sidebar of the entry.

If a document contains a checkbox as below you will be able to start it as a
[process](/net-doc/docs/concepts/processes).

```md
- [ ] Checkbox
```
