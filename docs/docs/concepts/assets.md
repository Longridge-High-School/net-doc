# Assets

Assets are a collection of [fields](/net-doc/docs/concepts/fields) that group
[entries](/net-doc/docs/concepts/entries).

## Name Field

All assets have a field that is defined as their _name field_. This field is
used as the always present first column in lists which is the link to the entry.

It is also used when adding a [relation](/net-doc/docs/fields/relation) to
another asset.

## Icons

Assets have an icon which is any emoji. Be aware that emoji does render
differently on each OS, even within versions.
