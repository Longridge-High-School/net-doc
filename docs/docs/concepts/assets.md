# Assets

Assets are a collection of [fields](/net-doc/docs/concepts/fields) that group
[entries](/net-doc/docs/concepts/entries).

## Name Field

All assets have a field that is defined as their _name field_. This field is
used as the always present first column in lists which is the link to the entry.

It is also used when adding a [relation](/net-doc/docs/fields/relation) to
another asset.

## Icons

Assets have an icon which is any emoji. Be aware that emoji does render
differently on each OS, even within versions.

## Fields

Any field can be added to an asset. When adding a field you set the _Helper
Text_ which is the text that will appear under the field in the editors. The
order is a numerical order for the field in the forms and display. A field can
be set to unique within the asset, or globally within the whole of Net-Doc.
