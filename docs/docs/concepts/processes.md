Any [document](/net-doc/docs/concepts/documents) that contains a checkbox
`- [ ]` can be started as a process. Simply open the document and click _Run
Process_.

A process can be edited like any document.

Any checkbox can be checked interactively on the process display, this is then
saved in the markdown.
