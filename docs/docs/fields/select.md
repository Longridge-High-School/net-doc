# Relation Field

The select field allows you to create a dropdown selector from your supplied
values.

## Examples

- Cabinet for Switch
- VMs on Host.

## Configuration

When creating a select field you will be asked for `Options`. This is a list,
one per line, of options that will appear in the selector.

> Be careful not to delete options as any entry edited after that will default
> to another option.

## Dashboard Boxes
